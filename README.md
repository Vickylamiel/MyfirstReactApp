<!-- Question 2 -->
List five significant features of React
1. Components: React applications are built using reusable components that can be easily composed to create complex user interfaces.

2. Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual DOM [Document Object Model] to efficiently update the UI by comparing the current state of the DOM with the desired state. This reduces the need for expensive and time-comsuming DOM operations, resulting in faster rendering.

3. JSX: React uses JSX [JavaScript Extention] syntax to enable the mixing of JavaScript and HTML, making it easy to write and understand complex UI code.

4. One-way data flow: React uses one-way data flow modelwheredata flows down from the parent components to the child components. This helps to reduce bugs and makes it easier to reason about the state of the application.

5. React Native: React Native is a framework for building native mobile applications. This allows developers to write once and deploy to multiple platforms resulting in faster development cycles and reduced costs.

<!-- Question 3 -->
List five major advantages of React
1. Increased Productivity: React component based architecture and reusable UI components allow developers to build complex user interfaces quickly and efficiently.

2. Improved Performance: React use of a virtual DOM allows it to efficiently update only the parts of the UI that have changed, resulting in faster rendering and a smoother user experience.

3. Easy to learn: React simple syntax and strianghtforward programming model makes is easy for developers to laern and use.

4. Large and active community: React has alarge and active community of developers, which provides resources, tutorials and support for those using the library.

5. Reusability: React components are reusable meaning they can be used across  ultiple projects. This helps to reduce development time and costs.

<!-- Question 4 -->
What is the name of the Software Engineer that created React? Also, which company owns React?
React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook. React is originally owned by Facebook.

<!-- Question 5 -->
What are the notable differences between HTML & JSX? Give at least 3 of them
1. Syntax: The syntax of HTML is quite different from that of JSX. HTML uses tags enclosed in angle brackets (<>) to define elements, whereas JSX uses a syntax similar to HTML but with some differences, such as using curly braces ({}) to include JavaScript expressions inside elements.

2. Attributes: In HTML, attributes are defined using key-value pairs within the opening tag of an element. In JSX, attributes are also defined as key-value pairs, but the key is typically in camelCase format rather than hyphenated format (as in HTML). Additionally, in JSX, you can use JavaScript expressions as attribute values, which is not possible in HTML.

3. Components: JSX allows you to define custom components, which are reusable pieces of UI that can be composed together to build more complex UIs. In contrast, HTML does not provide a built-in way to define custom components. Instead, you have to rely on HTML's standard set of elements and attributes, or use a separate programming language or framework to define custom components.

<!-- Question 6 -->
Why canâ€™t browsers read JSX?
Browsers can't directly read or interpret JSX because it is not a stsndard web language. It needs to be complied or transpiled into standard JavaScript code before it can be executed in the browser.




<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
